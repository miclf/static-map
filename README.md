# ðŸ—º StaticMap

A PHP package for generating static maps from map tile servers. Think of it as taking a screenshot of specific locations on OpenStreetMap.

## Requirements

This package uses the [GD library](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.image.php). You probably already have it, since itâ€™s almost always installed by default with PHP.

## Installation

You can install the package via the [Composer dependency manager](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require miclf/static-map
```

## Usage

The most straightforward way to use the package is by providing coordinates (latitude and longitude) and the path where the generated map will be saved.

```php
<?php

use Miclf\StaticMap\StaticMap;

// This generates a map centred on the Atomium, in Brussels.
StaticMap::centeredOn(50.89492, 4.34152)->save('path/to/map.png');
```

You can also provide a specific zoom level to use:

```php
// Specify the zoom level as a third argument to the constructor.
StaticMap::centeredOn(50.89492, 4.34152, 10)->save('path/to/map.png');

// Alternatively, you can also specify a zoom level with a dedicated method.
StaticMap::centeredOn(50.89492, 4.34152)
    ->withZoom(10)
    ->save('path/to/map.png');
```

### Options

Several aspects of the generated maps can be customised.

#### Width and height of the image

```php
// Generates a map with a width of 500px and a height of 250px.
StaticMap::centeredOn(50.89492, 4.34152)
    ->withDimensions(500, 250)
    ->save('path/to/map.png');
```

#### Tile provider

By default, the maps are rendered using the [â€˜Terrainâ€™ style from Stamen Design](http://maps.stamen.com/#terrain).
If, for example, you would like to use the tiles provided by [GEO-6](https://geo6.be/) for [OpenStreepMap Belgium](https://tile.osm.be) instead, use the `withTileProvider()` method to specify the URL template to use.

Please donâ€™t forget to provide proper [attribution](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright/en) to the tile provider and the OSM contributors when using the generated maps. StaticMap is not able to do that for you.

```php
StaticMap::centeredOn(50.89492, 4.34152)
    ->withTileProvider('https://tile.openstreetmap.be/osmbe/{z}/{x}/{y}.png')
    ->save('path/to/map.png');
```

### â€˜debugâ€™ mode

Basically, StaticMap works by identifying which tiles are required for the map, depending on the coordinates and zoom level. It then downloads the tiles and groups them all in a single picture. Finally, it crops the image so that the map is centred on the specified latitude and longitude.

If youâ€™re curious, you can enable a â€˜debugâ€™ mode to generate a map showing this process:

```php
StaticMap::centeredOn(50.89492, 4.34152)
    ->debug()
    ->save('path/to/map.png');
```

This mode has no real purpose apart from this educational aspect.
